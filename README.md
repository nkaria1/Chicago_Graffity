# Chicago_Graffity
Data visualisation for graffity in the city of chicago based on data from government records from https://data.cityofchicago.org/ This analysis uses publically available dataset. I collected the data from chicago city database for graffity removal requests. This contains information about the zip code, longitude, latitude and date of the request. I processed this to a csv and use the co-ordinate to depict the information in a map using R. This exercise is designed to familiarize with R code, and plotting functionality with R.
